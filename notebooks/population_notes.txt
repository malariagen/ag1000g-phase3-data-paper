Weird gambiae-like with some complex history. 

2012 Kenyan Kilifi intermediate.

2013 Tanzania intermediate gambiae. Some classify as gambiae though. More detail needed to define. 


COLUZZII

CAR coluzzii seem to be one set. 

CMS coluzzii seem to have a fair bit of structure.
Certianly Youande and Douala and Nk and Campo are distinct from Lagdo/Gouna.
The former are more similar to CAR the latter 



GAMBIAE

Gulf West Africa- TheGambia and Guinea Bissau.
8 sampling locations in an approximate square.
5 in The Gambia, 3 in GB.

Broadly there is an intermediate cluster, a gambiae cluster (small), a coluzzii cluster.

IM: 
1. Sare Samba Sowe
2. Njabakunda
3. Antula GB
4. Safim GB

Very interestingly, the IM cluster gts pulled out by PC6. The 2 GB populations are distinct from the Gambia ones. 


COL: (all Gambia)
1. Tankular
2. Wali Kunda
3. Kalataba
4. Njabakunda
5. Sare Samba Sowe

GAM:
1. Leibala - the most easterly of the GB sites. The other 2 are close, but one is more urban.
2. Wali Kunda - the most easterly of the Gambia sites. Not quite as easterly as Leibala. (only 2 samples here)

Populations:
 - All Coluzzii clearly belong in one population. Doesn't split by PCA.
 - Leibala forms it's own cluster.
 - IM: Question here is whether to make 2 or 1 cluster. Given 250km and crossing 2 major rivers. We should consider as 2.

Gambia Coluzzii
Gambia Intermediate
Guinea-Bissau Intermediate
Guinea-Bissau Leibala Gambiae

The 2 Gambiae in Wali Kunda can't be considered a population.
