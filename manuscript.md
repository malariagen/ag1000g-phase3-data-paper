## Population Sampling

The third and final phase of the Ag1000g project data resource contains wild-caught _Anopheles_ mosquito genomes from Sub-Saharan Africa, collected from a total of 124 sites across 19 countries, 6 of which are novel.

Collections from Mali increase the density of coverage in West Africa, Central African Republic and Democratic Republic of Congo begin to fill the gap previously present in Central Africa while Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania provide much more power to analyse East African malaria vectors, including _A. arabiensis_ an important vector species not previously sequenced in the project.

Alongside sampling from natural populations, we include colony individuals from a number of laboratory crosses, comprising 11 crosses that were released as part of phase 2, and 4 additional pedigrees.

![Sample Collection Map](images/sample_collection_map.svg){#fig:sample_collection_map width="100%"}

## Whole Genome Sequencing and Alignment {.page_break_before}

4,693 individual mosquito genomes were sequenced on either Illumina HiSeq2000 (n=3,130) or Illumina HiSeqX (n=1,563) to a target coverage of 30X.

Between machine types the median number of bases sequenced per sample was 9.76Gb and 10.33Gb respectively, representing a difference in yield (two-tailed mann-whitney U p < 0.0001).

These values correspond to a yield per reference base (vs AgamP4) of 35.76X and 37.82X. 

91.9% of HiSeqX runs and 80.5% of HiSeq2000 runs met the target yield of 30X.

Reads were aligned to the AgamP4 reference and Single Nucleotide Polymophisms (SNPs) called using GATK UnifiedGenotyper.

All samples successfully completed the pipeline and entered the sample quality control (QC) process.

### Sample QC

For wild-caught samples (n=3964), the QC process was composed of three stages, 
sequence quality assurance, replicate handling, and anomaly detection.
A total of 642 samples were removed where sequencing was of insufficient quality 
to accurately call genotypes across the whole genome.
Exclusions were due to poor coverage (n=398), potential contamination (n=219), 
and an ambiguous sex call (n=25).
Where technical replicates were available, we excluded 4 pairs (8 samples) with low genotype concordance. 
Where pairs met the concordance threshold we excluded the lower quality sample (n=403).
Samples were also screened pairwise within submission sets for unexpected pairs, though none were detected.
The third QC stage used principal component analysis (PCA) 
to identify and exclude individual samples that were outliers based on available metadata.
A review process identified samples that could not be explained parsimoniously, 
and were therefore likely to be sample mix ups or instances of mislabelling.
28 samples were excluded as they respectively dominated the first principal components, 
indicating high divergence from all other samples and therefore likely members of other Anopheline species.
A further 82 samples were excluded as potential sample mix ups.
Following all sample QC steps, 2,784 wild-caught samples (70.2%) were retained for analysis.

The AG1000G-X submission set, made up of experimental laboratory crosses, 
was subject to a slightly different QC process.
Firstly an analysis based on rates of Mendelian error identified true fathers of crosses 
(where multiple males were introduced to cages), and validated provided pedigrees.
Of the 729 samples sequenced we were able to validate 15 independent crosses to a high level of confidence, comprising 299 samples.
4 of these crosses are novel relative to phase 2.
These samples went through a modified sequence quality assurance process, 
a single sample was removed for potential contamination (methods).

The final data release therefore comprises 3,081 samples, 297 from laboratory crosses, and 2,784 wild collected samples.

This represents an increase of 1,939 mosquitoes relative to the phase 2 release.
9 biological samples included in phase 2 fail the updated sample QC process in phase 3.
Due to a change in assessment of sample quality where technical replicates are available,
_i.e_ looking at mean/median skew rather than taking the sample with the greatest coverage,
the preferred replicate was changed for 172 mosquitoes between phase 2 and phase 3.

### Species assignment and sex calling

The _Anopheles gambiae_ complex is a crypic group of sibling species,
with no single locus offering unambiguous resolution of species.
To identify species we looked beyond the conventional set of PCR based markers
and applied a wider set of ancestry informative markers (AIMs).
Species were not assigned to samples from laboratory colony crosses
due to inbreeding and high levels of genetic drift.
To distinguish _A. arabiensis_ from _A. gambiae s.l_ a set of novel markers 
was derived from data from the 16 genomes project [@my-16genomes].
Using cut offs based on agreement with the established PCR marker, 
368 individuals were classed as _A. arabiensis_ and 2415 as _A. gambiae s.l_. 
A single individual collected in Tororo, Uganda is classed as intermediate-
given the majority (93.9%) of AIM SNPs in the genome are heterozygous between 
the gambiae-like and arabiensis-like alleles, this individual is likely to be an F1 hybrid.
To resolve the _A. gambiae s.l_ individuals as _A. gambiae_ and _A. coluzzii_ 
we applied 729 AIMs previously identified by Neafsey et al [@my-neafsey-aim].
and used in previous analyses of Ag1000G data [@my-phase1;@my-phase2].
Of the 2,415  _A. gambiae s.l_ individuals, 
1571 were called as _A. gambiae s.s_, 675 as _A. coluzzii_ and 169 as intermediate.
Many intermediate samples are from the Western coast of West Africa (particularly The Gambia and Guinea Bissau),
and given distinct populations of _A. gambiae s.l._ and _A. coluzzii_ are also found in this region, 
this result highlights the complexity of species relationships here.
Additionally a number of samples were classed as intermediate in coastal populations of East Africa, 
in Kilifi Kenya, and Muleba Tanzania.

It is established that species barriers between members of the _An. gambiae_ complex are porous,
and numerous instances of introgression associated with selection have been observed in West Africa, 
particularly of the _kdr_ allele [@my-clarkson-introgression;@my-lee-introgression].
In West African coluzzii populations (2011 onwards), 
frequency of gambiae-like alleles around this locus reach 90%, 
_e.g._ Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Ghana, Guinea and Mali.
In Southern Africa, _An. coluzzii_ from Luanda, Angola (2009) 
also show high frequency of gambiae alleles at this locus (83.9%).
However no introgression is observed in _coluzzii_ collections prior to this; 
Cameroon (2005, n=7), Mali (2004, n=36) and the Central African Republic (1993/4, n=18) 
all have gambiae alleles present at rates below 1%.
Due to this known introgression, chromosome 2L was not considered when assigning species within _An. gambiae s.l._.

### SNP filtering and quality

Site filtering is necessary to ensure that reported variation is of high quality.

Features of specific regions of the Anopheles genome contribute to calling errors in short-read technologies; such features include regions of high divergence from the reference, high homology between regions, copy number variation, or the presence of transposable elements.

Where previously we have used manually curated cutoffs based on observed mendelian error rates to filter sites (ref phase1, phase2), here we built a statistical model where cohort level summary statistics were used to identify sites likely to contain genotyping errors.

Using the 15 available Anopheles pedigrees previously described, we used the presence of mendelian error at sites as a proxy for genotype discordance.

10 of the 15 crosses were used to train the model while 5 were held out for validation.

Each of the 5 pedigrees represent independent evaluation sets.

Before applying the site filters, the false discovery rate (FDR) of the 5 crosses over all autosomal sites ranged between 0.74% and 1.10% (table XXX).

The application of the site filters defines the accessible fraction of the autosomes at 72.58%, and the range of false discovery rates is 0.04% to 0.10%.

The median fold change of FDR was -3.71.


On the hemizygous X chromosome we used the more direct measure of heterozygote calls in males to ascertain mendelian error.

In the dataset are 220 _A. gambiae s.l_ male samples, each of which represent an independent proxy for genotype discordance.

Pre-application of the site filters, subject to a Genotype Quality (GQ) threshold of 30, the median heterozygosity rate was 0.244%, and post filtering this drops to 0.023% (table XX).

The median fold change in error rate was -3.33, with 69.97% of the X chromosome passing site filters.

The new model based method represents a marked improvement over the site filters generated as part of phase 2; all 5 evaluation pedigrees showed a modest reduction in FDR, but the higher rate of accessibility in this release (72.58% vs 62.05%) resulted in an significant improvement in Youden score (Table XXX) across autosomes.

The X chromosome showed a similar pattern, the median heterozygosity rate in phase 2 is similar to the new site filters (0.028%), but the higher accessibility in the updated filter set (69.97%  vs 62.46%) yields improved sensitivity.

As genomic features vary between species, different sets of site filters were generated to allow high quality analyses both within and between species. 

The `gamb_colu` site filters were generated as above, and are appropriate for analyses that include _gambiae_ and _coluzzii_ samples only.

%% TODO Add accessibility of other site filters.
The `arab` site filters were generated following application of the model to the summary statistics from arabiensis samples in the cohort (n=XXX), this set of site filters are appropriate when working with _A. arabiensis_ samples only.

Finally, the `gamb_colu_arab` site filters allow analyses across all three species and are the intersection of the `gamb_colu` and the `arab` site filters.

### Genome accessibility

We define accessibility as the fraction of sites in a region passing the appropriate set of site filters.

Overall, 70% of the genome, and ??% of the exome are considered accessible in the `gamb_colu` set.

This is an improvement from phase 2, where XXX of the genome, and YYY of the exome was considered accessible.

As expected, accessiblity was generally lower around the centromeres, and in regions of heterochromatin (table ref).

One notable region of low accessibility spans 40-41Mbp of chromosome 3R, this corresponds to ??.

Accessibility of the `arab` site filters closely follows that of `gamb_colu`, with the exception of the X chromosome where we see substantially lower values.

This appears to be driven by high divergence between AgamP4 and our _A. arabiensis_ samples, particularly around the Xag inversion at Q-Q Mbp, ref figure.

On the autosomes the divergence from the reference is comparable between _A.arabiensis_ and _A. gambiae_/ _A. coluzzii_ samples, suggesting a strong basis for comparison accross species.

The median divergence (Dxy) of 100kbp windows is XXX (5%/95% TTT/SSS) for gambiae/coluzzii and YYY (TTT/YYY) for arabiensis.  

On the X chromosome these values are XXX ( / ) for gambiae/coluzzii and YYY (  / ) for arabiensis.
 
### SNP discovery

Overall, we report XX,XXX,SSS single nucleotide polymophisms (SNPs) segregating in this cohort that pass filters, of which XX,XXX (%) are multiallelic.

12,223 SNPs are segregating in both species groups, while XXX are private to gambiae_/coluzzii_ and YYY to arabiensis [fig ref].

This phase of the study reports an additional XXX SNPs from phase 2.

In XXX gambiae and coluzzii individuals we report 12,222,222 SNPs (Q% multiallelic), corresponding to a SNP every 1.6 accessible bases.

In XXX arabiensis individuals we identify 10,000,000 SNPs (Q% multiallelic), a SNP every 2.5 accessible bases.

## Population Structure

### Genome wide patterns

%% TODO NOtes currently.

Re-introduce key idea of structure being different across the genome. 

How does arabiensis fit into this? Are there regions of the genome where arabiensis ancestry is secondary?


### PCA / UMAP

To highlight population structure we performed principal component analysis across all wild-caught samples in the dataset.

To avoid confounding of structure in genomic regions including paracentric inversions, extremely low diversity and regions under strong selection, we limited our analysis to euchromatic regions of chromosome 3L. 

The most apparent signal in the dataset is PC1 clearly being driven by Arabiensis, with clear separation of arabiensis samples from gambiae/coluzzii. 

The apparent hybrid sits between gambiae and arabiensis samples.

To view population structure within gambiae/coluzzii and arabiensis more independently, we performed subsequent PCA analysis Arabiensis and gambiae/coluzzii individuals separately. 

Population structure between gambiae and coluzzii is significantly more complex. 



Separately between species. What are the major findings?

- Arabiensis drives PC1. 

- East Africa: Seems to be clear population structure between _gambiae_ in KE and TZ.

- According to AIM analysis, a significant proportion of samples in these groups are classed as IM between gambiae. Certainly not coluzzii, but some kind of complex ancestry. 

- Relevance to TENEGLRA

- West Africa- in far west Africa we see intermediate population. Not gambiae coluzzii, unlikely to be hybrids, but a related subspecies. 

Interestingly seems to be stable in the presence of both gamb and colu. Although they sit close to col in the PCA they are distinct from coluzzii, given they are founf at the same site.

### Genetic Diversity within sampling sites

Better to avoid use of population.

Using species groupings above, i.e. PCA clusters of samples not clearly gambcolu, but sympatric with them are classed as intermediate. 

First look at diversity at a regional level within species. ie gambiae is more diverse in west than east africa. Central?

Coluzzii is similar within its range. 

Arabiensis only found in EA, but do we see differences in diversity?

Justification of using wattersons theta.

THEN, we can start to speak about differences between species, within regions. 

West African gambiae have higher diversity than coluzzii. 

Then how do west african intermediate compare to these?

In east africa, we compare gambiae to arabiensis. 


## Insecticide Resistance

- kdr frequencies in different sampling groups
- we don't have CNVs... so? We can use markers?

## Gene Drive

- repeat of phase 2 analysis.

## Population Sampling

### Summary

The Ag1000G project is coordinated by a consortium of partners from a range of different research institutions and countries.
This includes consortium members who are carrying out independent research studies in malaria endemic regions, and who have contributed mosquito specimens or mosquito DNA samples collected in the course of their own research.
The methods presented here describe the studies that have contributed samples to phase 3 of the Ag1000G project, including wild-caught samples from 19 African countries.
This section also provides information about the collection locations and methods, the people involved in the studies, and references to any published articles providing further information about the studies. 
Throughout this document we use species nomenclature following Coetzee _et al._ [@my-coetzee].
Unless otherwise stated, the DNA extraction method used for the collections described below was Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen Science, MD, USA).

#### Study information

The Target Malaria project contributed samples from collections made in three villages separated by at most 30km: Bana __[(11.233, -4.472)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=11.233&mlon=-4.472&zoom=12&layers=M)__, Souroukoudinga __[(11.235, -4.535)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=11.235&mlon=-4.535&zoom=12&layers=M)__ and Pala __[(11.150, -4.235)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=11.150&mlon=-4.235&zoom=12&layers=Mi)__. 
These collections were made in July-August 2012, July and October 2014, and January, February and April 2015.
The area is agricultural, with rice-growing areas near Bana and Souroukoudinga, and a large mango grove near Pala.
Female mosquitoes were collected by human landing catch, pyrethrum spray collection or aspiration. 
Males were collected by swarm netting. 
Both _An. gambiae_ and _An. coluzzii_ [@pubmed:17177993] were collected. 
Specimens were stored in 80% ethanol and DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen) or using a simple CTAB method.

### Cameroon (2) {.page_break_before}

#### Sample sets

`AG1000G-CM-B`

#### Study information
These samples were collected as part of a study which took place in Cameroon in Central Africa. 
The country is commonly referred to as "miniature Africa", owing to the diversity of its climate, topography, landscape,
and bio-ecological settings: arid savannas in the north gradually turn into rain forest in the south, 
along with highland areas, contribute to increase diversity of ecological settings.
Anopheline mosquitoes were collected in 2005 from 64 locations covering a 1,500 km north-to-south transect
that crossed all eco-geographical areas of Cameroon [@doi:10.1186/1472-6785-9-17]
Mosquito collection involved spraying aerosols of pyrethroid insecticides inside human dwellings, 
dead mosquitoes were retrieved from white sheets that were laid on the floor.
Anopheline mosquitoes were identified using morphological identification keys [@isbn:9780620103213;@gillies1968].
Ovaries from half-gravid An. gambiae s.l. females were dissected and stored in Carnoy's fixative solution
(absolute ethanol:glacial acetic acid 3:1) for cytogenetic analyses. 
Carcasses were stored individually in tubes containing a desiccant and kept at -20^o^ C 
until they were processed for molecular analysis. 
All half-gravid specimens collected in each village were identified to species and molecular forms using PCR-RFLP [@my-fanello].

### Guinea and Mali (1) {.page_break_before}

#### Sample sets

`AG1000G-GN-A`, `AG1000G-GN-B`

#### Study information

Collections were made from four different study sites around the border between Guinea and Mali.
From Mali; Takan __[(11.47,-8.33)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=11.47&mlon=-8.33&zoom=12&layers=M)__ 
and Toumani Oulena __[(10.83,-7.81)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=10.83&mlon=-7.81&zoom=12&layers=M)__ 
are both small villages in the Yanfolila district of southern Mali and represent the Sudanian savannah ecological zone.
Takan is arid savannah, while Toumani Oulena is humid savannah.
In Guinea Conakry, mosquitoes were sampled from Koraboh __[(9.28,-10.03)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=9.28&mlon=-10.03&zoom=12&layers=M)__,
a small village in the Kissidougou district in the Faranah region representing a semi-forest site with intermediate ecology,
a mix of savannah and forest, and in Koundara __[(8.48,-9.53)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=8.48&mlon=-9.53&zoom=12&layers=M)__,
a small village in the Macenta district in the Nzerekore region representing deep forest ecology.
All reported collections occurred in October and November 2012.
At each site, mosquitoes were collected using three different methods: human-landing capture, 
indoor manual aspirator or pyrethroid spray catch, 
and larval capture - where the first and second instar larvae were raised to adult in a field insectary 
under standard insectary conditions prior to DNA isolation from the adults, 
and the third and fourth instar larvae were preserved directly for DNA isolation, 
without rearing in the insectary.

The two distinct methods of larval collection were used to 
control for possible genetic bias inherent in lab rearing of captured larvae.
Across sites, all types of larval sites were sampled, 
including both temporary and permanent sites.
Human-landing captures were performed both inside dwellings 
and outside (>10 m from dwelling) at night between 18:00 and 06:30.
The indoor aspirator or spray catches were done in the morning between 06:00 and 12:00.
Adult specimens or third and fourth instar larvae were preserved immediately in 80% ethanol until later DNA extraction.
First and second instar larvae were raised to adults in nearby field insectaries and upon emergence were preserved in 80% ethanol.
DNA was extracted from mosquitoes using DNAzol by the provided protocol (Invitrogen, CA, USA).

### Tanzania {.page_break_before}

#### Sample sets

`AG1000G-TZ`

#### Study information

Tanzanian samples were collected from four distinct locations.
Moshi samples came from lower Mabogini __[(-3.400, 37.350)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-3.400&mlon=37.350&zoom=12&layers=M)__,
rice fields near lower Moshi on the southern slope of Mount Kilimanjaro, 
a region shown to have increasing resistance to pyrethroids [@doi:10.1186/1756-3305-7-274].
Mosquitoes were collected as larvae, during the rice growing season in August-September 2012, 
raised to adults and females bioassayed in WHO tubes for one hour with 0.05% lambda cyhalothrin [@https://www.who.int/malaria/publications/atoz/9789241511575/en/].
Alive and dead mosquitoes were preserved over silica.
In Tanzanian samples screened in Kabula et al. [@doi:10.1111/j.1365-3156.2012.02986.x].
Moshi was the most pyrethroid resistant population, 
they were found to be completely DDT susceptible, 
only in one out of 642 mosquitoes assayed by [@doi:10.1186/1756-3305-7-274].
was found to carry a _kdr_ resistance mutation (Vgsc-995F).

Tarime collections took place in the village of Komaswa __[(-1.417, 34.183)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-1.417&mlon=34.183&zoom=12&layers=M)__ 
about 410 km north west of Moshi, during August 2012.
Mosquito larvae were collected, raised to adults and females bioassayed 
with a range of insecticides in WHO tubes for one hour [@https://www.who.int/malaria/publications/atoz/9789241511575/en/].
finding almost complete multi-insecticide susceptibility: 
permethrin (100% mortality), lambda cyhalothrin (97%), fenitrothion (100%), 
DDT (100%) and bendiocarb (100%) [@doi:10.1186/s12936-019-2738-6].

Muheza samples were collected from Zeneti village __[(-5.217, 38.650)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-5.217&mlon=38.650&zoom=12&layers=M)__,
northeast Tanzania.
Malaria is intense and perennial with transmission peaking after the rainy season in May and June [@doi:10.1111/j.1365-3156.2012.02986.x].
Mosquitoes were sampled between November 2012 and May 2013.
Indoor resting collections were used to obtain live females for deltamethrin susceptibility testing 
and pyrethrum spray catches were used for mosquitoes that were collected for blood meal analysis.
Collections were conducted between 06:00 and 09:00 from randomly selected houses.
Live mosquitoes collected for susceptibility testing were provided with
10% glucose solution and transported to the field insectary.
Mosquitoes were sorted and morphologically identified to species,
carcasses were stored individually over desiccant for laboratory processing.

Muleba __[(1.750, 31.667)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=1.750&mlon=31.667&zoom=12&layers=M)__, 
the final collection region, is in the North-western part of Tanzania.
The district is known to be a malaria epidemic prone area with unstable transmission of varying seasonality.
The highest peak of malaria transmission is usually reached between May-July and November-January, 
which results from proceeding rain seasons.
There have been malaria vector control efforts since 2007 
when indoor residual spraying using lambda cyhalothrin was introduced.
Insecticide resistance in this district is coupled with high frequency of 
_kdr_ pyrethroid target site mutations in the _An. gambiae s.s._ population [@doi:10.1186/1756-3305-7-274;@doi:10.1186/1475-2875-12-149].
Sampling was conducted over six months, 
which include both dry and rainy season and covers 6 villages selected to represent all major ecological systems in the district.

### The Gambia (1) {.page_break_before}

#### Sample sets
`AG1000G-GM-A`

#### Study information

Indoor resting female mosquitoes were collected by pyrethrum spray catch from four hamlets around 
Njabakunda __[(13.55, -15.90)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=13.55&mlon=-15.90&zoom=12&layers=M)__, North Bank Region, 
The Gambia between August and October 2011.
The four hamlets were Maria Samba Nyado, Sare Illo Buya, Kerr Birom Kardo, and Kerr Sama Kuma; all are within 1 km of each other.
This is an area of unusually high hybridization rates 
between _An. gambiae s.s._ and _An. coluzzii_ [@doi:10.1186/1475-2875-7-182;@pmc:PMC3606099].
Njabakunda village is approximately 30km to the west of Farafenni town and 4km away from the Gambia River.
The vegetation is a mix of open savannah woodland and farmland.
With apparent high gene-flow in the region, it is problematic to assign species to these samples.

### Colony crosses {.page_break_before}

#### Sample sets

`AG1000G-X`

#### Study information

15 crosses were contributed to Ag1000G phase 3, 
11 of which were previously released in Ag1000G phase 2.
Crosses were generated using parents from eight different colonies: 
G3 (MRA-112); Kisumu (MRA-762); Pimperena (canonical representative of _An. gambiae_ species; MRA-861); 
Ghana (recent colony of _An. coluzzii_ from Okyereko, southern Ghana [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004236].
Mali-NIH (canonical representative of _An. coluzzii_ species; Niono, MRA-860); 
(P)Akron (Benin, MRA-913); Nagongera (Tororo, Uganda); and Tiassalé (southern Côte d’Ivoire [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004236].
The cross family labels, _e.g._ `29-2`, are identifiers 
used for each of the crosses within the contributor project and have no special meaning.

_Anopheles gambiae_ is a swarm-mater and crosses were therefore undertaken in mixed groups 
involving 4-10 females from a single colony with 1-4 males from each from a different colony 
in plastic cups covered with netting with 10% sugar water provided ad libitum.
Females were fed on human blood. After 3 days, males were removed and individually preserved in 95% ethanol.
Gravid or half-gravid females were then removed and placed in 1.5ml Eppendorf tubes.
Females that did not appear gravid were given a second blood meal before placing in Eppendorf tubes for egg laying.
Following egg deposition, females were removed and stored in tubes containing ethanol for subsequent DNA extraction.
Eggs were floated in clear plastic trays (15x10x5cm) 
and following hatching, larvae were raised on finely-ground fish food (Tetramin).
Trays were checked daily and pupae were placed individually into small, labelled centrifuge tubes.
Offspring were removed on eclosion and stored in individual tubes containing ethanol.
DNA was extracted from parents and offspring using the Qiagen DNeasy kit.

A preliminary assessment of the father of each cross was obtained by genotyping 
seven microsatellite loci in the mother, potential fathers and five or six offspring.
Where possible, the colony of origin of each father was established using individual 
clustering of the mothers and fathers in BAPS version 5.2, 
with cluster identity mapped to colony of origin via the mothers 
(for which the colony was known) [@doi:10.1101/gr.262790.120].

The four crosses that are novel to phase 3: B5, K2, K4 and K6, 
required further analysis to ascertain the true father of each cross, 
given mother and offspring.
For each cross for which the father was in doubt, the list of potential parental pairs was determined.
For each of these pairs Mendelian error was computed for every 
sample of the progeny and the median value (among samples) was plotted.
In these four crosses (B5, K2, K4 and K6) one pair yielded median Mendelian errors 
significantly lower for every autosome than all other pairs, 
identifying the parsimonious parents.
Two of the novel crosses, K4 and K6, were found to be fathered by the same male, `AC0398`.

## Whole Genome Sequencing

All library preparation and sequencing was performed at the Wellcome Sanger Institute.

Paired-end multiplex libraries were prepared using the manufacturer's protocol, with the exception that genomic DNA was fragmented using Covaris Adaptive Focused Acoustics rather than nebulization.

Multiplexes comprised 12 tagged individual mosquitoes and three lanes of sequencing were generated for each multiplex to even out variations in yield between sequencing runs.

Cluster generation and sequencing were undertaken according to the manufacturer's protocol for paired-end sequence reads with insert size in the range 100-200 bp.

4,693 individual mosquitoes were sequenced in total, of which 3,130 were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform and 1,563 were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq X platform.

All individuals were sequenced to a target coverage of 30X.

HiSeq 2000 sequencing runs generated 100 bp paired-end reads, while HiSeq X sequencing runs generated 150 bp paired-end reads.

## Alignment and SNP calling

Reads were aligned to the AgamP4 reference genome using `bwa` version 0.7.15.

Indel realignment was performed using GATK version 3.7-0 `RealignerTargetCreator` and `IndelRealigner`.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms were called using GATK version 3.7-0 `UnifiedGenotyper`.

Genotypes were called for each sample independently, in genotyping mode, given all possible alleles at all genomic sites where the reference base was not `N`.

Coverage was capped at 250X by random down-sampling.

Complete specifications of the __[alignment](https://github.com/malariagen/pipelines/blob/v0.0.4/docs/specs/short-read-alignment-vector.md)__ and __[genotyping](https://github.com/malariagen/pipelines/blob/v0.0.4/docs/specs/snp-genotyping-vector.md)__ pipelines are available from the __[malariagen/pipelines](https://github.com/malariagen/pipelines)__ GitHub repository.

Open source WDL implementations of the __[alignment](https://github.com/malariagen/pipelines/tree/v0.0.4/pipelines/short-read-alignment-vector)__ and __[genotyping](https://github.com/malariagen/pipelines/tree/v0.0.4/pipelines/SNP-genotyping-vector)__ pipelines are also available from GitHub.

Following successful completion of these pipelines, samples entered the sample quality control (QC) process.


## Sample QC

The following subsections describe analyses performed to identify and exclude samples from the final dataset.

### Coverage

For each sample, depth of coverage was computed at all genome positions.

Samples were excluded if median coverage across all chromosomes was less than 10X, or if less than 50% of the reference genome was covered by at least 1X.

### Cross-contamination

To identify samples affected by cross-contamination, we implemented the model for detecting contamination in NGS alignments described in @doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2012.09.004.

Briefly, the method estimates the likelihood of the observed alternate and reference allele counts under different contamination fractions, given approximate population allele frequencies.

Population allele frequencies were estimated from the Ag1000G phase 2 data release @doi:10.1101/gr.262790.120.

The model computes a maximum likelihood value for a parameter α representing percentage contamination.

Samples were excluded if α was 4.5% or greater.

### Technical replicates

A number of samples were sequenced more than once within this project phase (technical replicates).

To create a final dataset without any replicates suitable for population genetic analysis, we performed an analysis to confirm all technical replicates, and to choose the sample within each replicate with the best sequencing data.

We computed pairwise genetic distance between all sample pairs within a submission set.

The distance metric used was city block distance between genotype allele counts, to allow for handling of multiallelic SNPs.

So, _e.g._, distance between genotypes of `0/1` and `0/1` is 0, distance between `0/0` and `0/1` is 2, distance between `0/1` and `1/2` is 2, distance between `0/0` and `1/1` is 4, etc.

For each pair of samples, distance was averaged over all sites where both samples had a non-missing genotype call.

Computations were initially carried out on a down-sampled set of 10 x 100,000 contiguous genomic sites, to be computationally feasible.

Where a pair of samples fell beneath a conservative threshold of 0.012, the genetic distance was then recomputed across all genomic sites (_i.e._, without down-sampling).

For each pair of samples that were expected to be technical replicates according to metadata records, we excluded both members of the pair if genetic distance was above 0.006.

Where an expected replicate pair had genetic distance below 0.006, we retained only one sample in the pair.

We also identified and excluded both samples in any pair where genetic distance was below 0.006, where samples were not expected to be replicates.

### Population outliers

We used principal component analysis (PCA) to identify and exclude individual samples that were population outliers.

SNPs were down-sampled to use 100,000 segregating non-singleton sites from chromosomes 3R and 3L, to avoid regions complicated by known introgression loci or paracentric inversions.

PCA was computed using `scikit-allel` version 1.2.0.

We iteratively identified and excluded any individual samples that were outliers along a single principal component.

We then identified and excluded any individual samples or small sample groups that clustered together with other samples in a way that was not plausible given metadata regarding their collection location.

### Colony crosses

Samples in the `AG1000G-X` sample set were parents and progeny from colony crosses and were subject to a slightly different QC process.

For each cross, we performed an analysis of Mendelian inheritance and consistency to confirm the true parents and the validity of the cross.

Not all crosses were able to be successfully resolved, and samples that were not in a resolved cross were excluded.

From the samples originally submitted in the `AG1000G-X` sample set, 297 samples from 15 crosses were retained for release.

We did not include the colony crosses in the population outlier analysis due to their relatedness.

### Sex calling

We called the sex of all samples based on the modal coverage ratio between the X chromosome and the autosomal chromosome arm 3R.

The sample was classed as male where the coverage ratio was between 0.4-0.6, and female between 0.8-1.2.

Where the ratio was outside these limits, the sample was excluded.

One of the sample sets from The Gambia, `AG1000G-GM-B`, included whole-genome amplified (WGA) samples which displayed some skew in their coverage ratios, which meant that sex could not be called via the same process.

These samples received a sex call where possible, but no samples were excluded based on uncertain sex call.


## Species assignment

We assigned a species to each individual that passed sample QC using their genomic data, via two independent methods: ancestry-informative markers (AIMs) and principal components analysis (PCA).


### Species calling via ancestry-informative markers

To derive AIMs between _A. arabiensis_ and _A. gambiae_, we used publicly available data from the _Anopheles_ 16 genomes project (@doi:10.1126/science.1258522). 

Whole genome SNP calls for 12 _A. arabiensis_ and 38 _A. gambiae_ individuals were used.

Alleles were mapped onto the same alternate allele space, and allele frequencies were computed for both species.

Sites that were multiallelic in either group were excluded, as well as sites where any genotypes were missing. 

565,329 SNPs were identified as potentially informative, where no shared alleles were present between groups.

These were spread throughout the genome, but were concentrated on the X chromosome (63.2%), particularly around the Xag inversion.

We randomly down-sampled these SNPs to a set of 50,000 AIMs, then computed the fraction of alleles at these SNPs that were arabiensis-like for each individual in the Ag1000G phase 3 cohort.

Given the relatively small number of _A. arabiensis_ samples in the 16 genomes project, it was clear that a significant proportion of putative AIMs were not likely to be truly informative across the broader sampling in Ag1000G.

Individuals in Ag1000G were classed as _A. arabiensis_ where a fraction >0.8 of alleles were arabiensis-like.

To resolve the non-_A. arabiensis_ individuals into _A. gambiae_ and _A. coluzzii_, we applied the AIMs previously used in @doi:10.1101/gr.262790.120.

For each individual, we computed the fraction of coluzzii-like alleles at these AIMs.

Individuals were called as _A. gambiae_ where this fraction was <0.12 and _A. coluzzii_ where this fraction was >0.9, with individuals in between classed as intermediate.


### Species calling via principal components analysis

To provide a complementary view of species assignments, we also used the results of the principal components analysis of Chromosome 3 computed during the outlier analysis described above.

Based on a comparison with the AIM species calls, it was apparent that the first two principal components could be used to assign species.

Individuals where PC1 > 150 were called as _A. arabiensis_.

Individuals where PC1 < 0 and PC2 > -7 were called as _A. gambiae_.

Individuals where PC1 < 0 and PC2 < -24 were called as _A. coluzzii_.

All other individuals were called as intermediate.

The results of the PCA and AIM species calls were highly concordant in most sample sets, except for the Far West (Guinea-Bissau, The Gambiae) and Far East (Kenya, Tanzania).

Further investigation is required to resolve the species status of these individuals.



## Site filtering

We developed filters that identify genomic sites where SNP calling and genotyping is likely to be less reliable in one or more mosquito species.

To guide the design and calibration of the site filters, we made use of the 15 colony crosses included in this release.

Each cross comprises two parents and up to 20 progeny, allowing identification of sites where genotypes in one or more progeny are not consistent with Mendelian inheritance (Mendelian errors).

A small number of Mendelian errors may be due to _de novo_ mutation, but the vast majority of Mendelian errors are likely to be due to errors in sequencing, alignment or SNP calling.

The general approach we took was to use Mendelian consistency to identify sets of positive and negative training sites, then used these to train a machine learning model that classified all genomic sites as either PASS or FAIL.

### Site filters for use with _A. gambiae_ and/or _A. coluzzii_

All the 15 crosses involved _A. gambiae_ and/or _A. coluzzii_ parents, while none of the crosses involved _A. arabiensis_.

We therefore used the crosses to first develop site filters suitable for use with _A. gambiae_ and/or _A. coluzzii_.

Hereafter we refer to these filters as the `gamb\_colu` site filters.

Five of the 15 crosses were held out for validation, so performance could be evaluated objectively.

Sites were assigned to the positive training set where all genotypes across all 10 training crosses were called, and no Mendelian errors were observed.

Sites were assigned to negative training set where one or more Mendelian errors were observed in any cross.

All other sites were not considered eligible for inclusion in model training.

A balanced training set was then generated containing 100,000 autosomal sites from each of the positive and negative training sets.

The inputs to the machine learning model were a set of per-site summary statistics computed from the sequence read alignments and SNP genotypes across all wild-caught _A. gambiae_ and _A. coluzzii_ individuals.

These input summary statistics are described further in the appendix.

Male individuals were excluded from the summary statistic calculations, so that the model could also be applied without modification to the X chromosome.

We used these summary statistics, together with the positive and negative training sites, to train a decision tree model.

We initially trained a set of trees with different hyperparameter values, exploring the depth of trees, and the number of samples allowed at a terminal node.

Each of these trees was evaluated on an unbalanced set of sites randomly sampled from the whole genome (2% of all sites, without replacement).

Leaves of these trees contained different proportions of positive and negative training sites, and by increasing the cutoff for these proportions required to label a leaf as PASS, we were able to compute the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) for each set of hyperparameter values.

The best performing hyperparameter set based on AUROC was selected as the final model, and the leaf classification cutoff used was optimised based on the Youden statistic.

The resulting model was a decision tree of depth 8, where leaves were assigned to PASS where > 0.533 of training data in that leaf were positive training sites.

All sites in the genome were then assigned to PASS or FAIL via this model.

The 5 remaining cross pedigrees were used to perform a final evaluation of the approach.

For each of these crosses, we computed the Mendelian error rate (fraction of variants with one or more Mendelian errors among progeny) before and after applying the site filters, to provide five independent evaluation results.

We also evaluated performance on the X chromosome using heterozygote calls in males as indicator of error rates.

The fraction of variants with a heterozygous genotype call in or more males was computed before and after applying site filters.

Male error rates were estimated from genotype calls with a minimum Genotype Quality (GQ) value of 30.

### Site filters for use with _A. arabiensis_

To generate site filters for use with _A. arabiensis_, we recomputed site summary statistics using only wild-caught _A. arabiensis_ individuals, then applied the decision tree model described above.

These filters, which we refer to as the `arab` site filters, are appropriate when working with _A. arabiensis_ samples only.

### Site filters for joint analyses of all three species

We created site filters suitable for joint analysis of individuals from all three species by taking the intersection of the `gamb\_colu` and the `arab` site filters.

We refer to these filters as the `gamb\_colu\_arab` site filters.
