### Species assignment and sex calling

Ancestry informatice markers were used to assign species in our cohort.

To derive markers informative between _A. arabiensis_ and _A. gambiae s.l._, we used publicly available data from the 16 genomes project (ref). 

Whole genome SNP calls called against the AgamP3 reference for 12 _A. arabiensis_ and 38 _A. gambiae s.l_ individuals were available.

Alleles were mapped onto the same alternate allele space, the frequencies of which were computed across both groups.

Sites that were multiallelic in either group were excluded, as well as sites where any genotypes were missing. 

565,329 SNPs were identified as potentially informative where no shared alleles were present between groups.

These were spread throughout the genome, but were concentrated on the X chromosome (63.2%), particularly around the Xag inversion.

The full AIM set of positions and alleles are available as part of the phase 3 data release.

Called genotypes for each individual in the dataset were cross referenced against a random subset of 50,000 ancestry informative marker alleles, genotype alleles were accordingly classified as gambiae-like or arabiensis-like.

AIM fractions were cross referenced against PCR results available from a subset of inviduals.

Given the relatively small number of _A. arabiensis_ samples in the 16 genomes project- it was clear that a significant proportion of putative AIMs were not likely to be truly informative.

Therefore, classification requirements are less rigourous than other sets of validated markers; individuals were classed as _A. arabiensis_ where a fraction >0.6 of alleles were arabiensis-like (n=368), and as _A. gambiae s.l_ where this value was < 0.03 (n=2415).

Species were not assigned to samples from the AG1000G-X submission due to inbreeding and high levels of genetic drift.

A single individual collected in Tororo, Uganda is classed as intermediate- given the majority (XX%) of sites in the genome are heterozygous between the gambiae and arabiensis allele, this individual is likely to be an F1 hybrid.

To resove the _A. gambiae s.l_ individuals into _A. gambiae_ and _A. coluzzii_ we applied the 729 AIMs previously identified by Neafsey et al (ref).

Cutoffs were made at <0.12 (gambiae) and >0.9 (coluzzii), with individuals between classed as intermediate. 

Of the 2415  _s.l_ individuals, 1571 were called as gambiae, 675 as coluzzii and 169 as intermediate (ref collection map). 

### SNP filtering and quality

Site filtering ensures that reported variation is of high quality.

As genomic features vary between species, different sets of site filters were generated to allow high quality analyses both within and between species. 

The `gamb_colu` site filters were generated using a decision tree model, and are appropriate for analyses that include _gambiae_ and _coluzzii_ samples only.

Inputs to the decision tree model are summary statistics from the set of SNP calls and genotype alignments.

The `arab` site filters were generated following application of the resulting model to the summary statistics from arabiensis samples in the cohort, this set of site filters are appropriate when working with _A. arabiensis_ samples only.

Finally, the `gamb_colu_arab` site filters allow analyses across all three species and are the intersection of the `gamb_colu` and the `arab` site filters.


Using the 15 available Anopheles pedigrees previously described, we used the presence of mendelian error at sites as a proxy for genotype discordance.

Where previously we have used manually curated cutoffs based on observed mendelian error rates to filter sites (ref phase1, phase2), here we built a statistical model where cohort level summary statistics were used to predict the presence or absence of mendelian error, becoming a binary classification problem.

Summary statistics used as input to the model are presented in table (ref). 

Pedigrees included _A. gambiae_ and _A. coluzzii_ mosquitoes only, and summary statistics to build the initial site filters model came from females of these species (n=2415). 

Males were excluded, so that the model could also be applied without modification to the X chromosome.

5 of the 15 crosses were held out for validation, so performance could be evaluated objectively.

Sites were defined as PASS where all genotypes across all 10 remaining crosses were called, and no mendelian inconsistencies were observed.

Sites were defined as FAIL where a mendelian inconsistency was observed in any pedigree.

All other sites were not considered eligible for inclusion in model training.

A balanced training set was generated from the remaining 10 crosses containing XXX autosomal(?) sites.

We applied a decision tree, as it provides decisions with clear explanations, and is similar in concept to the set of hard thresholds commonly used in SNP calling in non-model organisms.

A set of trees with different parameter settings were learned, exploring the depth of trees and the number of samples allowed at a terminal node.

Parameter settings were evaluated on an unbalanced evaluation set, consisting of XXX sites randomly from sampled from the whole genome.

Leaves of the trained models contain different proportions of PASS sites, by increasing the cutoff for these proportions required to label a leaf as PASS, we were able to compute the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) for each parameter set.

The best performing parameter set based on AUROC was selected as the final model, the classification cutoff used was optimised based on the Youden statistic.

The resulting model was a decision tree of depth 8, with a maximum of XX (CHECK NUMBERS) terminal nodes, where leaves were assigned to PASS where > 0.533 of training data in that leaf were PASS.

All sites in the genome were then assigned to PASS or FAIL given the model inputs.


The 5 remaining cross pedigrees were used to perform a final evaluation of the approach.

Above definitions of PASS sites were retained, but independently within pedigrees, providing 5 distinct evaluation sets.

To evaluate performance on the hemizygous X chromosome we use the more direct measure of heterozygote calls in males.

In the dataset are 220 _A. gambiae s.l._ male samples, each of which represent an independent proxy for genotype discordance.

Male error rates were estimated from genotype calls with a minimum Genotype Quality (GQ) value of 30.

A non heterozygote call is labelled PASS, and a heterozygote call FAIL.

Error rates were computed for all crosses, over all chromosomes before and after application of site filters.

We report the false positive rate (FPR), (i.e proportion of the genome considered accessible), and the Youden statistic (ratio of sensitivity to specificity).
