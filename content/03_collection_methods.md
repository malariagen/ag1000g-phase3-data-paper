## Population Sampling

### Summary

The Ag1000G project is coordinated by a consortium of partners from a range of different research institutions and countries.

This includes consortium members who are carrying out independent research studies in malaria endemic regions, and who have contributed mosquito specimens or mosquito DNA samples collected in the course of their own research.

The methods presented here describe the studies that have contributed samples to phase 3 of the Ag1000G project, including wild-caught samples from 19 African countries.

This section also provides information about the collection locations and methods, the people involved in the studies, and references to any published articles providing further information about the studies. 

Throughout this document we use species nomenclature following Coetzee et al. (2013).

Unless otherwise stated, the DNA extraction method used for the collections described below was Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen Science, MD, USA).

#### Sample sets

`AG1000G-AO`.

#### Study information

Adult mosquitoes were obtained by rearing larvae collected from breeding sites along the main roads connecting the municipalities of Kilamba-Kiaxi and Viana, Luanda province __[-8.821,13.291](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-8.821&mlon=13.291&zoom=12&layers=M)__, in April/May 2009.

These are peri-urban areas where malaria reaches hyperendemic levels.

All specimens collected in the study area were typed as _A. coluzzii_~\parencite{fanello_2002_simultaneous} although \emph{An. melas} and _A. arabiensis_ have also been recorded in the province~\parencite{cuamba_2006_malaria,calzetta_2008_distribution}.

Specimens were stored on silica gel and DNA extraction was performed by a phenol-chloroform protocol described in \textcite{donnelly_1999_population}.
