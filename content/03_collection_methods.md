## Population Sampling

Mosquitoes, from natural populations, were collected at 124 sites (unique latitude/longitudes) in 19 sub-Saharan African countries (Figure 1; Supplemental Table @@??). 

95 of these sites are novel to Ag1000G phase 3, including 19 sites in six newly sampled countries, the remainder were previously sampled in phases 1 and 2 of the project (@doi.org/10.1038/nature24995; @@phase 2 doi when published).

New samples present in phase 3 comprised the following:

**Burkina Faso**

Two new submissions of collections from Burkina Faso are included here. The first added collections made in three villages separated by at most 30km: Bana (11.233, -4.472), Souroukoudinga (11.235, -4.535) and Pala (11.150, -4.235).

These collections were made in July and October 2014, and January, February and April 2015. The area is agricultural, with rice-growing areas near Bana and Souroukoudinga, and a large mango grove near Pala.

Female mosquitoes were collected by human landing catch, pyrethrum spray collection or aspiration; males were collected by swarm netting. Both _An. gambiae_ and _An. coluzzii_ (@doi:10.1186/1475-2875-5-125) were collected. 

Specimens were stored in 80% ethanol and DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen).

The second new submission from Burkina Faso added collections of indoor resting adults made by spray catch from Monomtenga in central Burkina Faso (12.06, -1.17). 

These specimens were sorted morphologically to _An. gambiae_ s.l.

Ovaries of half-gravid females were dissected and placed in numbered individual micro-tubes containing modified Carnoy's solution (1:3 glacial acetic acid: 100% ethanol).

Carcasses were placed in correspondingly numbered micro-tubes over desiccant. Genomic DNA was isolated from individual mosquitoes using one of the following: DNeasy Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), Puregene kit (Gentra Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN), DNAzol kit (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH.) or Easy-DNA kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

_An. gambiae_ s.s. and its molecular forms were identified using one of two rDNA-based PCR/RFLP assays (@doi:10.1046/j.1365-2915.2002.00393.x;  @doi:10.4269/ajtmh.2004.70.604).

Ovaries from specimens of the desired species were subject to polytene chromosome analysis.

**Democratic Rebublic of the Congo**

Samples were collected from Gbadolite (4.283, 21.017), a town located in the far north of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) near the border with the Central African Republic, surrounded by forest.

In common with much of DRC, malaria transmission rates are high, and the samples are _An. gambiae_ s.s., which is the dominant vector.

Samples were collected as larvae from temporary pools within and around the town by dipping in early August 2015. All larvae were reared to adults and females preserved over silica for DNA extraction using Qiagen DNAEasy kits.

**Central African Republic**

Collections were carried out in Bangui (4.367, 18.583), during December 1993, by indoor resting aspiration or pyrethrum spray catch.

**Cameroon**

Two new submissions of samples from Cameroon are included in this phase. 

In the first submission anopheline mosquitoes were taken from 64 locations covering a 1,500 km north-to-south transect that crossed all eco-geographical areas of Cameroon (@doi:10.1186/1472-6785-9-17). 

Mosquito collection involved spraying aerosols of pyrethroid insecticides inside human dwellings, dead mosquitoes were retrieved from white sheets that  were laid on the floor.

Anopheline mosquitoes were identified using morphological identification keys (>>Gillies and De Meillon 1968<<@@how reference books with no ISBN?; @isbn:0620103213).

Ovaries from half-gravid _An. gambiae_ s.l. females were dissected and stored in Carnoy's fixative solution (absolute ethanol:glacial acetic acid 3:1) for cytogenetic analyses.

Carcasses were stored individually in tubes containing a desiccant and kept at -20°C until they were molecularly processed. All half-gravid specimens collected in each village were identified to species and molecular forms using PCR-RFLP (@doi:10.1046/j.1365-2915.2002.00393.x).

The second Cameroonian submission came from pyrethrum spray collections, larval sampling and human landing catches conducted in twenty locations during October 2013.

These villages are scattered throughout the country and reflect a gradient of human-dominated environments, for example, forest (Manda: 5.726, 10.868 and Campo: 2.367, 9.817); forest/savanna transition (Tibati: 6.469, 12.629); savanna (Lagdo: 9.049, 13.656); suburban area (Nkolondom: 3.972, 11.516) and 
urban areas (Douala: 4.055, 9.721 and Yaoundé: 3.880, 11.506).

Contributed specimens were _An. gambiae_ and _An. coluzzii_ (@doi:10.1046/j.1365-2915.2002.00393.x).

Population genomics studies indicated the presence of relatively differentiated subgroups within both species as well as clusters thriving in polluted breeding sites in large cities (@doi:10.1093/molbev/msx0877).

Specimens were stored on silica gel, and DNA was extracted using a Zymo research kit for adults and a Qiagen kit for larvae.

**Mayotte**

Phase 3 adds collections from three novel sites on the island of Mayotte. 

Samples were collected as larvae during March-April 2011 in temporary pools by dipping in  Tsounzou (-12.797, 45.185), Tsinkoura (-12.936, 45.138) and aerogare (-12.803, 45.283).

Larvae were stored in 80% ethanol prior to DNA extraction.

All specimens contributed were _An. gambiae_ (@doi:10.4269/ajtmh.2004.70.604) with the standard 2L<sup>+a</sup>/2L<sup>+a</sup> or inverted 2L<sup>a</sup>/2L<sup>a</sup> karyotype as determined by the molecular PCR diagnostics (@doi:10.4269/ajtmh.2007.76.334).

The samples were identified as males or females by the sequencing read coverage of the X chromosome using LookSeq (@doi:10.1101/gr.093443.109).

**Gabon** @@was this submission "GA-B" included in the release?? I can't see it in the meta data, delete?

_Anopheles_ sampling was carried out in three new locations in Gabon @@year?.

Adult _An. gambiae_ females were collected in Benguia (-1.633, 13.492) by human landing catches (National Research Ethics Committee of Gabon n°. 0031/2014/SG/CNE) in September 2015.

Benguia is a forest-savanna village with less than 300 inhabitants. Malaria is endemic across the year.

The specimens were stored immediately at -80°C.

_An. coluzzii_ larvae were sampled in Libreville (0.390, 9.454) and Cocobeach (0.992, 9.576) by dipping in natural breeding sites in January 2016.

Libreville is the capital of the country and it is urban and polluted site, Cocobeach is a coastal village north of Libreville.

Across both malaria is endemic across the year.

The specimens were stored in alcohol at -20°C.

Total genomic DNA was extracted for all the mosquitoes using the CTAB protocol (@doi:10.4269/ajtmh.2005.73.1077).

**The Gambia**

Two new submissions of samples from The Gambia are present in phase 3.

The first were collected along the Gambia River from the western coastal region of The Gambia, (Low River Area; Caputo et al. 2008), in August 2006. 

_An. gambiae_ and _An. coluzzii_ specimens were identified to species following the PCR-RFLP protocol (@doi:10.1046/j.1365-2915.2002.00393.x) using DNA extracted from the mosquito leg.

Only _An. coluzzii_ specimens were collected from villages of Tankular (13.417, -16.033) and Kalataba (13.550, -15.617). 

_An. gambiae_ and _An. coluzzii_ specimens were found in sympatry and collected from villages of Yallal Tankonjala (13.550, -15.700), Sare Samba Sowe (13.583, -15.900) and Hamdalai (13.567, -16.0167).

PCR-RFLP protocol also revealed the presence of mosquitoes with hybrid _An. gambiae_/_An. coluzzii_ genotype in Yallal Tankonjala and Sare Samba Sowe.

Collections of indoor daytime-resting half gravid mosquitoes were carried out mainly in human dwellings and, in few cases, in animal shelters.

Collections were carried out by pyrethroid and/or paper-cup mouth aspirators from 12 AM to sunset, and kept in vials with desiccant.

Ovaries were dissected, maintained into Carnoy fixative (three parts pure ethanol:one part glacial acetic acid) and stored at -20<sup>o</sup>C before polytene chromosome preparations (@doi:10.1186/1475-2875-7-182).

Chromosome scoring was carried out under a phase‐contrast optical microscope. 

Paracentric inversion karyotypes were scored according to the nomenclature and conventions of Coluzzi et al. (@doi:10.1016/0035-9203(79)90036-1) and Touré et al. (@pubmed:10645562).

The second new submission consists of adult mosquitoes collected at Wali Kunda in the rural, central river region of The Gambia (13.567, -14.917).

The area is 180 km from the sea, on the south bank of the River Gambia, in flat Sudan savannah with a small fishing village (and a research field station) as well as rice fields and swamplands.

The dominant _Anopheles_ vector species is _An. coluzzii_ (@doi:10.1186/s12936-016-1203-z).

Mosquitoes were captured using human landing collections both inside and outside huts for 19 days in October and November 2012. Mosquitoes were stored in RNAlater or dried over silica gel and stored at -20<sup>o</sup>C.

**Guinea and Mali**

A novel sample submission to phase 3 included collections from both Guinea and Mali.

Mosquitoes were collected from four different study sites at the border with Mali and in Guinea Conakry. Takan (11.47, -8.33) and Toumani Oulena (10.83, -7.81) are both small villages in the Yanfolila district of southern Mali and represent the Sudanian savannah ecological zone.

Takan is arid savannah, while Toumani Oulena is humid savannah.

In Guinea Conakry, we sampled in Koraboh, (9.28, -10.03) a small village in the Kissidougou district in the Faranah region representing a semi-forest site with intermediate ecology, a mix of savannah and forest, and in Koundara, (8.48, -9.53), a small village in the Macenta district in the Nzerekore region representing deep forest ecology. 

All reported collections occurred in October and November in 2012.

At each site, mosquitoes were collected using three different methods: human-landing capture, indoor manual aspirator or pyrethroid spray catch, and larval capture - where the first and second instar larvae were raised to adult in a field insectary under standard insectary conditions prior to DNA isolation from the adults, and the third and fourth instar larvae were preserved directly for DNA isolation, without rearing in the insectary.

The two distinct methods of larval collection were used to control for possible genetic bias inherent in lab rearing of captured larvae.

Across sites, all types of larval sites were sampled, including both temporary and permanent sites.

Human-landing captures were performed both inside dwellings and outside (>10 m from dwelling) at night between 18:00 and 06:30.

The indoor aspirator or spray catches were done in the morning between 06:00 and 12:00.

Adult specimens or third and fourth instar larvae were preserved immediately in 80% ethanol until later DNA extraction.

First and second instar larvae were raised to adults in nearby field insectaries and upon emergence were preserved in 80% ethanol.

DNA was extracted from mosquitoes using DNAzol by the provided protocol (Invitrogen, CA, USA).

Further details on sampling and basic Southern Mali/Guinea vector biology are presented in Coulibaly et al. (doi:10.1186/s12936-016-1242-5).

**Guinea Bissau**

Two new Guinea Bissau collection sites are added here, both performed in October 2010 by indoor CDC light traps.

Samples were also collected from Ga-Mbana (12.052, -14.902) and Leibala (12.272, -14.222).

Ga-Mbana is a rural village located along a main road in central Guinea Bissau, while Leibala is a neighbourhood of the eastern town of Gabu.

The samples of Ga-Mbana comprised _An. coluzzii_ whereas the samples of Leibala comprised _An. gambiae_, all being identified by IGS and SINEX markers as described in Vicente et al. (@doi:10.1038/srep46451).

The _kdr_ pyrethroid target site resistance mutation L1014F occurs at high frequency in Leibala but at very low frequency in Ga-Mbana (@doi:10.1038/srep46451).

Malaria is meso-hyperendemic (@doi:10.4269/ajtmh.2003.68.2.0680161) and sporozoite rates are below 1% in the region.

Specimens were stored on silica gel and DNA extraction was performed by a phenol-chloroform protocol described in Donnelly et al. (@doi:10.1038/sj.hdy.6885930).

**Kenya**

New Kenyan specimens were obtained from villages located in Kilifi County near the Kenyan coast between 2000 and 2014.

All Anopheles mosquito sampling was conducted indoors using CDC light traps.

_An. gambiae_, _An. funestus_, _An. arabiensis_ and _An. merus_ were present at sampling locations (@doi:10.4269/ajtmh.1993.49.520).

Sporozoite rates for the area during previous studies were 1.47% (@doi:10.1038/ncomms1672).

**Mali**

Two further submissions containing collections from 11 sites in Mali are new for phase 3.

In the first, collections were made in four villages in the Koulikoro region; Tieneguebougou (12.810, -8.080) approximately 20 km north of Bamako, 
and Kababougou (12.890, -8.150), Ouassorola (12.900, -8.160), Sogolombougou ( 12.880, -8.140), approximately 30 km north of Bamako.

The collections were made in August 2014 by human landing catch and pyrethrum spray catch.

Both _An. gambiae_ and _An. coluzzii_ (@doi:10.1046/j.1365-2915.2002.00393.x) were collected.

Specimens were stored in 80% ethanol.

In the second submission, collections of indoor resting adults were made by spray catch from seven villages in the southern part of Mali in August-September 2004: Banambani (12.800, -8.050), Bancoumana (12.200, -8.200), Douna (13.210, -5.900), Fanzana (13.200, -6.130), Kela (11.880, -8.450), Moribobougou (12.690, -7.870) and N'Gabakoro (12.680, -7.840).

Specimens were sorted morphologically to _An. gambiae_ s.l. 

Ovaries of half-gravid females were dissected and placed in numbered individual micro-tubes containing modified Carnoy's solution (1:3 glacial acetic acid: 100% ethanol).

Carcasses were placed in correspondingly numbered micro-tubes over desiccant.

Genomic DNA was isolated from individual mosquitoes using one of the following: DNeasy Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), Puregene kit (Gentra Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN), DNAzol kit (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH.) or Easy-DNA kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

_An. gambiae_ s.s. and its molecular forms were identified using one of two rDNA-based PCR/RFLP assays (@doi:10.1046/j.1365-2915.2002.00393.x; @doi:10.4269/ajtmh.2004.70.604).

Ovaries from specimens of the desired species were subject to polytene chromosome analysis.

**Malawi**

Specimens were obtained from villages within the catchment of the Majete Malaria Project, Chikhwawa District, Malawi (-15.933, 34.755) (@doi:10.1186/s12879-017-2749-2).

Mosquitoes were collected indoors and outdoors by Suna light trap in May 2015.

Chickhwawa District is an area with perennial and intense malaria transmission (@doi:10.4269/ajtmh.13-0028).

All specimens were _An. arabiensis_ (@doi:10.1046/j.1365-2915.2002.00393.x).

Additional details of vector population bionomics may be found in (@doi:10.1186/s12879-017-2749-2; @doi:10.1186/1475-2875-11-380).

Specimens were stored over silica and DNA was extracted using the Qiagen plate protocol.

**Mozambique**

Mosquito samples were collected in Furvela (-23.716, 35.299), Mozambique, by CDC light traps between December 2003 and April 2004.

Specimens were stored on silica gel and DNA was extracted according to Collins et al. (@doi:10.4269/ajtmh.1987.37.37).

Contributed specimens consisted of _An. gambiae_ individuals identified according to Fanello et al. (@doi:10.1046/j.1365-2915.2002.00393.x).

Furvela is a rural village located in Inhambane Province, where malaria is transmitted mainly by _An. gambiae_ and _An. funestus_ (@doi:10.1111/mve.12084).

_An. arabiensis_ and _An. merus_ are also found at low frequency.

Sporozoite rates around 4% have been reported in *An. gambiae* from Furvela (@doi:10.1111/mve.12084).

**Tanzania**

Tanzanian samples were collected from four distinct locations.

Moshi samples came from lower Mabogini (-3.400, 37.350), rice fields near lower Moshi on the southern slope of Mount Kilimanjaro, a region shown to have increasing resistance to pyrethroids (@doi:10.1186/1756-3305-7-274).

Mosquitoes were collected as larvae, during the rice growing season in August-September 2012, raised to adults and females bioassayed in WHO tubes for one hour with 0.05% lambda cyhalothrin (@isbn:9789241511575).

Alive and dead mosquitoes were preserved over silica.

In Tanzanian samples screened in Kabula et al. (@doi:10.1111/j.1365-3156.2012.02986.x), Moshi was the most pyrethroid resistant population, they were found to be completely DDT susceptible, only in one out of 642 mosquitoes assayed by Matowo et al. (@doi:10.1186/1756-3305-7-274) was found to carry a _kdr_ resistance mutation (Vgsc-995F).

Tarime collections took place in the village of Komaswa (-1.417, 34.183) about 410 km north west of Moshi, during August 2012.

Mosquito larvae were collected, raised to adults and females bioassayed with a range of insecticides in WHO tubes for one hour (@isbn:9789241511575), 
finding almost complete multi-insecticide susceptibility: permethrin (100% mortality), lambda cyhalothrin (97%), fenitrothion (100%), DDT (100%) and bendiocarb (100%) (Nyka, T. unpublished data – Insecticide Resistance Monitoring Report 2012. NIMR Tanzania).

Mulheza samples were collected from Zeneti village (-5.217, 38.650), northeast Tanzania.

Malaria is intense and perennial with transmission peaking after the rainy season in May and June (@doi:10.1111/j.1365-3156.2012.02986.x).
Mosquitoes were sampled between November 2012 and May 2013.

Indoor resting collections were used to obtain live females for deltamethrin susceptibility testing and pyrethrum spray catches were used for mosquitoes that were collected for blood meal analysis.

Collections were conducted between 06:00 and 09:00 from randomly selected houses.

Live mosquitoes collected for susceptibility testing were provided with 10% glucose solution and transported to the field insectary.

Mosquitoes were sorted and morphologically identified to species, carcasses were stored individually over desiccant for laboratory processing.
Muleba (1.750, 31.667), the final collection region, is in the North-western part of Tanzania.

The district is known to be a malaria epidemic prone area with unstable transmission of varying seasonality.

The highest peak of malaria transmission is usually reached between May-July and November-January, which results from proceeding rain seasons.

There have been malaria vector control efforts since 2007 when indoor residual spraying using Lambdacyhalothrin was introduced.

Insecticide resistance in this district is coupled with high frequency of _kdr_ pyrethroid target site mutations in the _An. gambiae_ s.s population (@doi:10.1111/j.1365-3156.2012.02986.x; @doi:10.1186/1475-2875-12-149).

Sampling was conducted over six months, which include both dry and rainy season and covers 6 villages selected to represent all major ecological systems in the district. 

**Uganda**

In Uganda, a single new site is sampled in phase 3.

In Kihihi subcounty, Kanungu District (-0.751, 29.701), resting mosquitoes were collected during October and November 2012.

Kihihi is located in an  upland area with seasonal malaria transmission (@doi:10.1186/1475-2875-13-111).

All specimens were _An. gambiae_ (@doi:10.1046/j.1365-2915.2002.00393.x).

Additional details of vector population bionomics may be found in (@doi:10.1186/1475-2875-13-1114).

Specimens were stored in 80% ethanol and DNA was extracted using the Qiagen plate protocol.

Details of natural population samples previously described in phases 1 and 2 can be found in the Supplementary Information of The Anopheles gambiae 1000 Genomes Consortium (@doi.org/10.1038/nature24995; @@phase 2 doi when published - respectively).

**Colony Crosses**

15 crosses were contributed to Ag1000G phase 3.

The crosses were generated using parents from eight different colonies: G3(MRA-112); Kisumu(MRA-762); Pimperena (canonical representative of _An. gambiae_ species; MRA-861); Ghana (recent colony of _An. coluzzii_ from Okyereko, southern Ghana (@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004236)); Mali-NIH (canonical representative of _An. coluzzii_ species; Niono, MRA-860); (P)Akron (Benin, MRA-913); Nagongera (Tororo, Uganda); and Tiassalé (southern Cote d’Ivoire (@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004236)).

The labels, e.g. “29-2”, are identifiers used for each of the crosses within the project and have no special meaning.

Full full details of cross production, sequencing and quality control is described in the Supplementary Information of The Anopheles gambiae 1000 Genomes Consortium (@doi.org/10.1038/nature24995).

The only difference between the production of the four crosses that are novel to phase 3: B4, K2, K4 and K6, and those from earlier phases of the project, is that multiple males and multiple females were placed together for mating, then all male and all egg laying female mosquitoes were sequenced.

This necessitated matching up potential fathers of crosses with the correct mother and offspring.

For each cross for which the father was in doubt, the list of potential parental pairs was computed. 

For each of these pairs, for each chromosome, the Mendelian error was computed for every sample of the progeny and the median value (along samples) was plotted for every computation. 

If one pair yielded median Mendelian errors significantly lower for every chromosome than any other pair (except X which was consistent no matter the parents), that pair was chosen as the parsimonious parents. 

In four crosses (B4, K2, K4 and K6) parental pairs could be clearly identified and these crosses could, therefore, be included in the phase 3 data release.

Two of the novel crosses, K4 and K6, were found to be fathered by the same male, AC0398.
