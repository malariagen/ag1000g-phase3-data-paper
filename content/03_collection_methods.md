## Population Sampling

### Summary

The Ag1000G project is coordinated by a consortium of partners from a range of different research institutions and countries.
This includes consortium members who are carrying out independent research studies in malaria endemic regions, and who have contributed mosquito specimens or mosquito DNA samples collected in the course of their own research.
The methods presented here describe the studies that have contributed samples to phase 3 of the Ag1000G project, including wild-caught samples from 19 African countries.
This section also provides information about the collection locations and methods, the people involved in the studies, and references to any published articles providing further information about the studies. 
Throughout this document we use species nomenclature following Coetzee _et al._ [@my-coetzee].
Unless otherwise stated, the DNA extraction method used for the collections described below was Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen Science, MD, USA).

### Angola

#### Sample sets

`AG1000G-AO`.

#### Study information

Adult mosquitoes were obtained by rearing larvae collected from breeding sites along the main roads connecting the municipalities of Kilamba-Kiaxi and Viana, Luanda province __[(-8.821,13.291)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-8.821&mlon=13.291&zoom=12&layers=M)__, in April/May 2009.
These are peri-urban areas where malaria reaches hyperendemic levels.
All specimens collected in the study area were typed as _A. coluzzii_ [@my-fanello] although _An. melas_ and _A. arabiensis_ have also been recorded in the province [@doi:10.1186/1475-2875-5-2;@doi:10.4269/ajtmh.2008.78.169].
Specimens were stored on silica gel and DNA extraction was performed by a phenol-chloroform protocol described in [@doi:10.1038/sj.hdy.6885930].

### Cameroon (1)

#### Sample sets
`AG1000G-CM-A`

#### Study information

Pyrethrum spray collections were conducted in three villages in Cameroon during September and October 2009.
These villages comprise a transect from forest (village of Mayos: __[(4.341, 13.558)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=4.341&mlon=13.558&zoom=12&layers=M))__ to forest/savanna transition (village of Daiguene: __[(4.777, 13.844)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=4.777&mlon=13.844&zoom=12&layers=M))__ to savanna (villages of Gado-Badzere and Zembe-Borongo: __[(5.747, 14.442)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=5.747&mlon=14.442&zoom=12&layers=M)__) (@doi:10.1186/1475-2875-9-293).

### Cameroon (2)

#### Sample sets

`AG1000G-CM-B`

#### Study information
These samples were collected as part of a study which took place in Cameroon in Central Africa. 
The country is commonly referred to as "miniature Africa", owing to the diversity of its climate, topography, landscape,
and bio-ecological settings: arid savannas in the north gradually turn into rain forest in the south, 
along with highland areas, contribute to increase diversity of ecological settings.
Anopheline mosquitoes were collected in 2005 from 64 locations covering a 1,500 km north-to-south transect
that crossed all eco-geographical areas of Cameroon [@doi:10.1186/1472-6785-9-17]
Mosquito collection involved spraying aerosols of pyrethroid insecticides inside human dwellings, 
dead mosquitoes were retrieved from white sheets that were laid on the floor.
Anopheline mosquitoes were identified using morphological identification keys [@isbn:9780620103213;@gillies1968].
Ovaries from half-gravid An. gambiae s.l. females were dissected and stored in Carnoy's fixative solution
(absolute ethanol:glacial acetic acid 3:1) for cytogenetic analyses. 
Carcasses were stored individually in tubes containing a desiccant and kept at -20^o^ C 
until they were processed for molecular analysis. 
All half-gravid specimens collected in each village were identified to species and molecular forms using PCR-RFLP [@my-fanello].

Contributed specimens were _An. gambiae_ or _An.coluzzii_ [@my-fanello].

Population genomics studies indicated the presence of relatively dierentiated subgroups within both species as well as clusters thriving in polluted breeding sites in large cities [@pubmed:28204524].

Specimens were stored on silica gel.

DNA was extracted using a Zymo research kit for adults, and a Qiagen kit for larvae.

### Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea

#### Sample sets

`AG1000G-GQ`

#### Study information

Collections were performed during the rainy season in September 2002 by overnight CDC light traps in Sacriba of Bioko island __[(3.7, 8.7)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=3.7&mlon=8.7&zoom=12&layers=M)__. 

Specimens were stored dry on silica gel before DNA extraction. 

Specimens contributed from this site were _An. gambiae_ females, genotype determined by two assays [@my-scott,@my-santolamazza].

All specimens had the 2L^+a^/2L^+a^ karyotype as determined by the molecular PCR diagnostics [@my-white].

These mosquitoes represent a population that inhabited Bioko Island before a comprehensive malaria control intervention initiated in February 2004 [@doi:10.1186/1475-2875-6-52].

After the intervention _An. gambiae_ was declining, and more recently almost only _An. coluzzii_ can be found [@doi:10.1186/1475-2875-11-56].

### Guinea and Mali (1)

#### Sample sets

`AG1000G-GN-A`, `AG1000G-GN-B`

#### Study information

Collections were made from four different study sites around the border between Guinea and Mali.
From Mali; Takan __[(11.47,-8.33)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=11.47&mlon=-8.33&zoom=12&layers=M)__ 
and Toumani Oulena __[(10.83,-7.81)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=10.83&mlon=-7.81&zoom=12&layers=M)__ 
are both small villages in the Yanfolila district of southern Mali and represent the Sudanian savannah ecological zone.
Takan is arid savannah, while Toumani Oulena is humid savannah.
In Guinea Conakry, mosquitoes were sampled from Koraboh __[(9.28,-10.03)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=9.28&mlon=-10.03&zoom=12&layers=M)__,
a small village in the Kissidougou district in the Faranah region representing a semi-forest site with intermediate ecology,
a mix of savannah and forest, and in Koundara __[(8.48,-9.53)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=8.48&mlon=-9.53&zoom=12&layers=M)__,
a small village in the Macenta district in the Nzerekore region representing deep forest ecology.
All reported collections occurred in October and November 2012.
At each site, mosquitoes were collected using three different methods: human-landing capture, 
indoor manual aspirator or pyrethroid spray catch, 
and larval capture - where the first and second instar larvae were raised to adult in a field insectary 
under standard insectary conditions prior to DNA isolation from the adults, 
and the third and fourth instar larvae were preserved directly for DNA isolation, 
without rearing in the insectary.

The two distinct methods of larval collection were used to 
control for possible genetic bias inherent in lab rearing of captured larvae.
Across sites, all types of larval sites were sampled, 
including both temporary and permanent sites.
Human-landing captures were performed both inside dwellings 
and outside (>10 m from dwelling) at night between 18:00 and 06:30.
The indoor aspirator or spray catches were done in the morning between 06:00 and 12:00.
Adult specimens or third and fourth instar larvae were preserved immediately in 80% ethanol until later DNA extraction.
First and second instar larvae were raised to adults in nearby field insectaries and upon emergence were preserved in 80% ethanol.
