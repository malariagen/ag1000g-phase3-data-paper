## Population Sampling

The third and final phase of the Ag1000g project data resource contains wild-caught _Anopheles_ mosquito genomes collected from a total of 124 sites across 19 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Six novel countries have been added in phase 3; collections from Malawi increase the density of coverage in West Africa, Central African Republic and Democratic Republic of Congo begin to fill the gap previously present in Central Africa while Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania provide much more power to analyse East African populations.

In phase three, new quality control and filtering pipelines were developed so all 4,693 samples submitted across the three project phases were evaluated with these new methods.

High quality whole genome sequences from 2784 unique individuals passed all sample filters, 2532 females, 223 males and 29 samples with unknown sex (see Methods).

1823 of these wild-caught individuals are novel to phase 3.

181 samples from phase 2 did not pass the new quality thresholds and are not included in this data release (@@ either - see Supplementary table OR explain 172 were lost via FILTER_second_rep_hi_skew <- then need to explain what this is?).

Alongside sampling from natural populations, @@nn individuals (parents and offspring) from @@nn lab crosses have been sequenced.

@@nn of these crosses are novel to phase 3.

Parents of crosses were drawn from the @@ and @@... colonies.

## Whole Genome Sequencing and Alignment {.page_break_before}

4,693 individual mosquitoes were sequenced on either Illumina HiSeq2000 (n=3,130) or Illumina HiSeqX (n=1,563) to a target coverage of 30X.

Between machine types the median number of bases sequenced per sample was 9.76Gb and 10.33Gb respectively, representing a difference in yield (two-tailed mann-whitney U p < 0.0001).

These values correspond to a yield per reference base (vs AgamP4) of 35.76X and 37.82X. 

91.9% of HiSeqX runs and 80.5% of HiSeq2000 runs met the target yield of 30X.

Reads were aligned to the AgamP4 reference and Single Nucleotide Polymophisms (SNPs) called using GATK UnifiedGenotyper.

All samples successfully completed the pipeline and entered the sample quality control (QC) process.

### Sample QC

The sample QC process was composed of three stages, sequence quality assurance, replicate handling, and anomaly detection.

668 samples were removed where sequencing was of insufficient quality to accurately call genotypes across the whole genome.

Exclusions were due to poor coverage (n=410), potential contamination (n=229), and an ambiguous sex call (n=29).

Where technical replicates were available, we excluded 4 pairs (8 samples) with low genotype concordance. 

Where pairs met the concordance threshold we excluded the lower quality sample (n=407).

Samples were also screened pairwise within submission sets for unexpected pairs, though none were detected.

The AG1000G-X submission set, made up of laboratory experimental crosses, was exempted from this step due to familial similarity and high levels of inbreeding.

The third stage used principal component analysis (PCA) to identify and exclude individual samples that were outliers based on available metadata.

A review process identified samples that could not be explained parsimoniously, and were therefore likely to be sample mix ups or instances of mislabelling.

28 samples were excluded as they respectively dominated the first principal components, indicating high divergence from all other samples and therefore likely members of other Anopheline species.

A further 82 samples were excluded as potential sample mix ups.

Following all sample QC steps, 3,483 samples (74.2%) were retained from the original cohort for analysis.

### Species assignment and sex calling

The Anopheles gambiae complex is a crypic group of sibling species, with no single locus offering unambiguous resolution of species.

To identify species we looked beyond the conventional set of PCR based markers and applied a wider set of ancestry informative markers (AIMs).

Species were not assigned to samples from laboratory colony crosses due to inbreeding and high levels of genetic drift.

To distinguish _A. arabiensis_ from _A. gambiae s.l_ a set of novel markers was derived from data from the 16 genomes project (ref).

Using cut offs based on agreement with the established PCR marker, 368 individuals were classed as _A. arabiensis_ and 2415 as _A. gambiae s.l_. 

A single individual collected in Tororo, Uganda is classed as intermediate- given the majority (XX%) of AIM SNPs in the genome are heterozygous between the gambiae-like and arabiensis-like alleles, this individual is likely to be an F1 hybrid.

To resolve the _A. gambiae s.l_ individuals as _A. gambiae_ and _A. coluzzii_ we applied 729 AIMs identified by Neafsey et al (ref), and used by us in previous analyses (ref paper2, paper1).

Of the 2415  _A. gambiae s.l_ individuals, 1571 were called as _A. gambiae s.s_, 675 as _A. coluzzii_ and 169 as intermediate (ref collection map). 

Many intermediate samples were sampled from the Western coast of West Africa (particularly The Gambia and Guinea Bissau), and given distinct populations of _A. gambiae s.l._ and _A. coluzzii_ are also found in this region, highlights the complexity of species relationships here.

### SNP filtering and quality

Site filtering is necessary to ensure that reported variation is of high quality.

Features of specific regions of the Anopheles genome contribute to calling errors in short-read technologies; such features include regions of high divergence from the reference, high homology between regions, copy number variation, or the presence of transposable elements.

Where previously we have used manually curated cutoffs based on observed mendelian error rates to filter sites (ref phase1, phase2), here we built a statistical model where cohort level summary statistics were used to identify sites likely to contain genotyping errors.

Using the 15 available Anopheles pedigrees previously described, we used the presence of mendelian error at sites as a proxy for genotype discordance.

10 of the 15 crosses were used to train the model while 5 were held out for validation.

Each of the 5 pedigrees represent independent evaluation sets.

Before applying the site filters, the false discovery rate (FDR) of the 5 crosses over all autosomal sites ranged between 0.74% and 1.10% (table XXX).

The application of the site filters defines the accessible fraction of the genome at 72.58%, and the range of false discovery rates is 0.04% to 0.10%.

The median fold change of FDR was -3.71.


On the hemizygous X chromosome we used the more direct measure of heterozygote calls in males to ascertain mendelian error.

In the dataset are 220 _A. gambiae s.l_ male samples, each of which represent an independent proxy for genotype discordance.

Pre-application of the site filters, subject to a Genotype Quality (GQ) threshold of 30, the median heterozygosity rate was 0.244%, and post filtering this drops to 0.023% (table XX).

The median fold change in error rate was -3.33, with 69.97% of the X chromosome passing site filters.

The new model based method represents a marked improvement over the site filters generated as part of phase 2. 

All 5 evaluation pedigrees showed a small reduction in FDR, but coupled with the lower rate of accessibility in phase 2 (62.05%) resulted in an significant improvement in Youden score (Table XXX) across autosomes.

The X chromosome showed a similar pattern, the heterozygosity rate is similar to the new site filters (0.028%), but the higher accessibility in the updated filter set (69.97%  vs 62.46%) yields improved sensitivity.

As genomic features vary between species, different sets of site filters were generated to allow high quality analyses both within and between species. 

The `gamb_colu` site filters were generated as above, and are appropriate for analyses that include _gambiae_ and _coluzzii_ samples only.

The `arab` site filters were generated following application of the model to the summary statistics from arabiensis samples in the cohort (n=XXX), this set of site filters are appropriate when working with _A. arabiensis_ samples only.

Finally, the `gamb_colu_arab` site filters allow analyses across all three species and are the intersection of the `gamb_colu` and the `arab` site filters.

### Genome accessibility

We define accessibility as the fraction of sites in a region passing the appropriate set of site filters.

Overall, 70% of the genome, and ??% of the exome are considered accessible in the `gamb_colu` set.

This is an improvement from phase 2, where XXX of the genome, and YYY of the exome was considered accessible.

As expected, accessiblity was generally lower around the centromeres, and in regions of heterochromatin (table ref).

One notable region of low accessibility spans 40-41Mbp of chromosome 3R, this corresponds to ??.

Accessibility of the `arab` site filters closely follows that of `gamb_colu`, with the exception of the X chromosome where we see substantially lower values.

This appears to be driven by high divergence between AgamP4 and our _A. arabiensis_ samples, particularly around the Xag inversion at Q-Q Mbp, ref figure.

On the autosomes the divergence from the reference is comparable between _A.arabiensis_ and _A. gambiae_/ _A. coluzzii_ samples, suggesting a strong basis for comparison accross species.

The median divergence (Dxy) of 100kbp windows is XXX (5%/95% TTT/SSS) for gambiae/coluzzii and YYY (TTT/YYY) for arabiensis.  

On the X chromosome these values are XXX ( / ) for gambiae/coluzzii and YYY (  / ) for arabiensis.
 
### SNP discovery

Overall, we report XX,XXX,SSS single nucleotide polymophisms (SNPs) segregating in this cohort that pass filters, of which XX,XXX (%) are multiallelic.

12,223 SNPs are segregating in both species groups, while XXX are private to gambiae_/coluzzii_ and YYY to arabiensis [fig ref].

This phase of the study reports an additional XXX SNPs from phase 2.

In XXX gambiae and coluzzii individuals we report 12,222,222 SNPs (Q% multiallelic), corresponding to a SNP every 1.6 accessible bases.

In XXX arabiensis individuals we identify 10,000,000 SNPs (Q% multiallelic), a SNP every 2.5 accessible bases.
