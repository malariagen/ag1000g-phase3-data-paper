## Population Sampling

DNA extracted from wild-caught _Anopheles_ mosquitoes were submitted to the Ag1000G consortium in 23 sets by consortial partners. (chris' line)

## Whole Genome Sequencing and Alignment

A total of 4,693 individual mosquitoes were sequenced on either Illumina hi-seq 2000 (n=XXX) or Illumina hi-seq X (n=XXX) to a target coverage of 30X.

The median number of bases sequenced per sample (_i.e._ number total reads x read length) was XXX and YYY respectively.

No significant difference in yield was observed between the two technologies (ttest p=0.XX).

Reads were aligned to the AgamP4 reference genome using `bwa` version `0.7.15`.

Indel realignment was performed using GATK `v3.7-0` RealignerTargetCreator and IndelRealigner. 

Single nucleotide polymophisms were called against AgamP4 using GATK UnifiedGenotyper `v3.7-0`.

Sample genotypes were called independently, in genotyping mode, given all possible alleles at each site, allowing parallelisation over samples.

Coverage considered at individual sites was capped at 250.

All samples successfully completed the pipeline and entered the sample quality control (QC) process.

### Sample QC

The sample QC process was composed of three stages, sequence quality assurance, replicate handling, and anomaly detection.

668 samples were removed where sequencing was of insufficient quality to accurately call genotypes across the whole genome.

Exclusions were due to poor coverage (n=410), potential contamination (n=229), and the autosomal vs X coverage ratio not following the expected bimodal distribution (n=29).

Where technical replicates were available, we excluded 4 pairs (8 samples) with low genotype concordance. 

Where pairs met the concordance threshold we excluded the lower quality sample.

In total 407 samples in were excluded in favour of better quality samples, based on skewedness of the mean vs median.

Samples were also screened pairwise within submission sets for unexpected pairs, though none were detected.

The AG1000G-X submission set, made up of laboratory experimental crosses, was exempted from the requirements of this stage due to familial similarity and high levels of inbreeding.

The third stage used principal component analysis (PCA) to identify and exclude individual samples that were outliers based on available metadata.

A review process identified samples that could not be explained parsimoniously, and were therefore likely to be sample mix ups or instances of mislabelling.

28 samples were excluded as they respectively dominated the first principal components, indicating high divergence from all other samples and therefore likely members of other Anopheline species.

A further 82 samples were excluded as potential sample mix ups.

Following all sample QC steps, 3,483 samples (74.2%) were retained from the original cohort for analysis.

Full details including exclusion thresholds are available in supplementary.
